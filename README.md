IGNORE THIS "MAIN" BRANCH AT ALL COSTS! 

ALL MAIN FILES ARE IN ["MAIN-BACKUP"](https://github.com/salvarez96/react-youtube-tutorial/tree/main-backup) BRANCH

I completely messed this branch while trying to setup gh-pages in my react-app. Well, shit happens so the new main branch is now "backup-main".

There's nothing useful here.
